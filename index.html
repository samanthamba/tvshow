She's always applying herself scholastically and doing well when asked to perform tasks that have instructions (notably she tells Mitchum Huntzberger she's always done what was asked of her, and receives a higher SAT score in maths than in verbal).</td>

Her parents had her future all planned out and arranged for her to come out to society after her sixteenth birthday, but Lorelai was always rebellious and resentful of her structured, sheltered and silver spoon upbringing.</td>
